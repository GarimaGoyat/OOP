If-statements only detect errors.
Exception handling both detects AND transfers control automatically.

Points you can say:

If-statements cannot jump out of multiple nested functions.

Exceptions stop normal execution and go directly to catch.

Code becomes cleaner and error-handling is separated.

Exceptions allow multiple catch types for different errors.

Some errors (hardware, system errors, memory) cannot be handled by simple if-statements.
